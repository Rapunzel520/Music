# How Far I'll Go

```markdown

I've been staring at the edge of the water
我一直凝视着大海的边缘

Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
自我记事起就如此 也不知缘由

I wish I could be the perfect daughter
我也希望做个乖女孩

But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try
但无论如何努力 还是会回到海边

Every turn I take, every trail I track
转几个弯 跨多少坎

Every path I make, every road leads back
峰回路转 每一条路

To the place I know, where I can not go, though I long to be
都指向我可望而不可即的地方

See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
看见那海天相吻的弧线了吗？ 它在呼唤我

And no one knows, how far it goes
没有人知道 那究竟有多远

If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
如果我把远航的扬起风甩在身后

One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go
有一天我会知道 此去征程 就不问路途多远

I know everybody on this island, seems so happy on this island
我熟悉这小岛上的每个人 自给自足幸福的他们

Everything is by design
独一无二的他们

I know everybody on this island has a role on this island
我知道他们都有各自的角色责任 与这小岛密不可分

So maybe I can roll with mine
所以也许我也该扮演好我的角色 守好本分

I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
带着身份的骄傲 让部族更加强盛

I'll be satisfied if I play along
一直这样下去我也会满足

But the voice inside sings a different song
但是内心的声音告诉我与众不同

What is wrong with me?
究竟是怎么了

See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
看见那海面上闪耀的光了吗？ 它如此耀眼

But no one knows, how deep it goes
但没有人知道 海有多深

And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
此时此刻它就在呼唤着我 快快出发找到我吧

And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
让我知道 那条弧线之后是什么 我会超越它吗

See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
看见那海天相吻的弧线了吗？ 它在呼唤我

And no one knows, how far it goes
没有人知道 那究竟有多远

If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
如果我把远航扬起的风甩在身后

One day I'll know, how far I'll go
总有一天我会知道 这场旅途会走多远
