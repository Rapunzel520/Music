# Cheap Thrills

```markdown

Come on, come on
快快快！

Turn the radio on
把收音机调到最大

It's Friday night and I won't be long
周五的夜晚不会太漫长的！

Gotta do my hair
梳好头发

I put my make-up on
画上浓妆

It's Friday night and I won't be long
一刻值千金，快快开始周五之夜的狂欢

Til I hit the dance floor
我疯狂的舞动

Hit the dance floor
载歌载舞 随心所欲

I got all I need
我已手握自己所需之物

No I ain't got cash
不 我没有钱财

No I ain't got cash
我并不富足

But I got you baby
但我已有了你

Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
我不要金钱来满足我的欲望

(I love cheap thrills)
简简单单亦是快乐

Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
我不要才来来填补内心

(I love cheap thrills)
平平淡淡亦有乐趣

But I don't need no money
我不需要任何钱财

As long as I can feel the beat
只要我能随着节奏摆动

I don't need no money
钱乃身外之物

As long as I keep dancing
只要我能随心的舞动就足矣

Come on, come on
快快快！

Turn the radio on
把收音机调到最大

It's Saturday night and I won't be long
周六的夜晚总是过得很快！

Gotta paint my nails
涂上亮丽的指甲油

Put my high heels on
踩着我们的恨天高

It's Saturday night and I won't be long
一刻值千金，快快开始周六的排队吧！

Til I hit the dance floor
我疯狂的舞动

Hit the dance floor
载歌载舞 随心所欲

I got all I need
我已手握自己所需之物

No I ain't got cash
不 我没有钱财

No I ain't got cash
