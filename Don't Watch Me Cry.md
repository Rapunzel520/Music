# Don't Watch Me Cry

```markdown
Oh, it hurts the most 'cause I don't know the cause
这伤痛最为致命 只因我不知其源

Maybe I shouldn't have cried when you left and told me not to wait
或许 当你离去 且嘱咐别再等待之时 我便不该为之哭泣

Oh, it kills the most to say that I still care
我称道依存关心 由此而来的杀害最为深莫

Now I'm left tryna rewind the times you held and kissed me back
现今 我想重回过去 你将我抱住又而给予亲吻的过去

I wonder if you're thinkin' "Is she alright all alone?"
我想得知 你是否在萦念“此久以来 她独自一人 可否安好”

I wonder if you tried to call, but couldn't find your phone
我想得知 你是否 竭尽全力请求援助 却无寻外力

Have I ever crossed your thoughts because your name's all over mine
我曾经有否细虑你的心思 只因你之一切俱步我身

A moment in time, don't watch me cry
时光转逝，别坐观我哭泣

A moment in time, don't watch me cry
岁月不待，别看我哀泣

I'm not crying 'cause you left me on my own
我不因你离我而去哭泣

I'm not crying 'cause you left me with no warning
我不因你无告而去哭泣

I'm just crying 'cause I can't escape what could've been
我只因自己难逃可能将至之事而哭泣

Are you aware when you set me free?
当你释我自由之时 可曾意识到

All I can do is let my heart bleed
我所能及只是让自己心血直流

Oh, it's harder when you can't see through the thoughts
这比你看不透多许心思还艰难

Not that I wanna get in, but I want to see how your mind works
并非我想参入，但我想得见你的心绪如何运转

No, it's harder when they don't know what they've done
不，这比他们无知己为还艰难

Thinking it's better they leave, meaning that I'll have to move on
觉得 他们最好离去，此后便意味着我必可持续前进

Oh, I wonder if you're thinkin' "Is she alright all alone?"
我想得知 你是否在萦念“此久以来 她独自一人 可否安好”

I wonder if you tried to call, but couldn't find your phone
我想得知 你是否 竭尽全力请求援助 却无寻外力

Have I ever crossed your thoughts because your name's all over mine
我曾经有否细虑你的心思 只因你之一切俱步我身

A moment in time, don't watch me cry
时光转逝，别坐观我哭泣

A moment in time, don't watch me cry
岁月不待，别看我哀泣

I'm not crying 'cause you left me on my own
我不因你离我而去哭泣

I'm not crying 'cause you left me with no warning
我不因你无告而去哭泣

I'm just crying 'cause I can't escape what could've been
我只因自己难逃可能将至之事而哭泣

Are you aware when you set me free?
当你释我自由之时 可曾意识到

All I can do is let my heart bleed
我所能及只是让自己心血直流
