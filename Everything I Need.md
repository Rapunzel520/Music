# Everything I Need

```markdown
Born on the wrong side of the ocean
生在肆意汪洋那错误的一岸

With all the tides against you
伴着所有的潮浪都拍打着你

You never thought you'd be much good for anyone
你从未想象过自己也能如此美好

But that's so far from the truth
但事实并非如此

I know there's pain in your heart
我知道你的心底埋藏着痛苦

And you're covered in scars
你被伤痕累累所覆盖

Wish you could see what I do
希望你能看到我所做的一切

'Cause baby, everything you are
因为亲爱的 你想要拥有的一切

Is everything I need
就是我需要的一切

You're everything to me
你是我生命的意义

Baby, every single part
亲爱的 你身体的每个部分

Is who you're meant to be
那就是你注定将要成为的模样

'Cause you were meant for me
因为你与我命中注定

And you're everything I need
你就是我需要的一切

You can say I'm wrong
你可以说我痴人说梦

You can turn your back against me
你可以背过头去不再理睬

But I am here to stay
但我永远在这儿等待

(I am here to stay)
我愿意在这里

Like the sea
就如海浪

She keeps kissing the shoreline
本该永远挚情吻着那海岸

No matter how many times he pushes her away
无论海岸多少次将海浪推开

'Cause baby, everything you are
因为亲爱的 你想要拥有的一切

Is everything I need
就是我需要的一切

You're everything to me
你是我生命的意义

Baby, every single part
亲爱的 你身体的每个部分

Is who you're meant to be
那就是你注定将要成为的模样

'Cause you were meant for me
因为你与我命中注定

And everything happens for a reason
世间万事皆有缘由

It's all a blessing in disguise
从那初明的天幕伊始

I used to question who I was
我曾经问自己到底是谁

Well now I see
如今我终于明晰

The answer's in your eyes
那答案就在你的心底

'Cause baby, everything you are
因为亲爱的 你想要拥有的一切

Is everything I need
就是我需要的一切

You're everything to me
你是我生命的意义

Baby, every single part
亲爱的 你身体的每个部分

Is who you're meant to be
那就是你注定将要成为的模样

'Cause you were meant for me
因为你与我命中注定

And you're everything I need
你就是我生命的意义
